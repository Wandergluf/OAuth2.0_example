## What is semantic parsing?
Semantic parsing is the process of mapping a natural language sentence into an intermediate logical form which is a formal representation of its meaning.

The formal representation should be a detailed representation of the complete meaning of the natural language sentence in a fully formal language that:

* Has a rich ontology of types, properties, and relations.
* Supports automated reasoning or execution.

## Representation languages
Early semantic parsers used highly domain-specific meaning representation languages, with later systems using more
